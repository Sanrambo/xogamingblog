                    CD Projekt Red releases the Cyberpunk 2077 Hotfix 1.04 update patch, which fixes the game's previously reported epilepsy and copyright issues.

            <div class="article">

                <p>Some of these issues popping up in <u class="article_underline"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></u> are rather mild (if a bit embarrassing), like reports of the player character's customizable private parts 
                clipping through their clothing. Others are far more serious, like copyrighted music <em>(which the game allows players to switch off for the purpose of streaming 
                Let's Play videos online)</em> continuing to play after being disabled and resulting in DMCA strikes. Another big concern is some parts of the game involving flashing
                strobe lights, which could trigger epileptic seizures in certain players. Luckily, CD Projekt Red has promised a Day One update patch to address these and many 
                more issues plaguing <u class="article_underline"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></u>, and now it's arrived right on schedule.  </p>

                <p>Earlier today, CD Projekt Red posted the details about this new patch, dubbed "Hotfix 1.04." This update will indeed address the problem of copyrighted music
                playing even after the option to block it is enabled, as well as altering the sequences involving flashing lights to make them safer for people prone to epileptic 
                seizures. Other fixes include removing various quest-specific bugs, reducing graphical pop-ups while driving, addressing multiple crashes, and making it easier to set 
                a player's default language while playing the game on <u class="article_underline">Steam</u>. The <u class="article_underline"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></u>
                Hotfix 1.04 patch is currently available on <u class="article_underline">Pc</u> and <u class="article_underline">Playstation</u> consoles, with CD Projekt Red 
                promising to release it for <u class="article_underline">Xbox</u> systems soon</p>

                <p>Aside from the technical issues plaguing it since before its launch yesterday, <u class="article_underline"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></u> has enjoyed a great deal of critical acclaim and 
                financial success, gaining more than <u class="article_underline">1 million players</u> on Steam in a single day. Star Keanu Reeves (who plays the punk rock revolutionary Johnny Silverhand) 
                celebrated this successful release with a special guest appearance at the 2020 Game Awards last night, where he presented the award for Best Game Direction to
                The Last of Us Part II.</p>
                <br>
                <p>While the large number of bugs and glitches present in Cyberpunk 2077 (as well as the troubling reports of its developers being crunched to 
                get the game finished on time) is unfortunate, at least CD Projekt Red is working to correct them in a timely manner. Hopefully, players will now 
                be able to enjoy the Witcher developer's gritty, futuristic sci-fi shooter without fear of a game crash, copyright strike, or epileptic seizure as 
                <u class="article_underline"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></u> continues to take the gaming world by storm. </p>
