               <p><u class="article_underline"><em><b>Apex Legends</b></em></u> director Chad Grenier refuses to crunch, while acknowledging that this could slow down updates to the game. The revelation comes shortly 
                  after Respawn made a quick change to its much-hated Season 7 Battle Pass.
               </p>
               <p>With <u class="article_underline"><em>Apex Legends</em></u> Season 7, Respawn implemented a few critical changes to how Battle Pass progression works. Instead of having different kinds of rewards that 
                  could’ve been slightly frustrating, the team decided to introduce stars as universal challenge rewards. To complete a single Battle Pass level, players need 
                  to collect a total of 10 stars, but it’s the overall slow progression towards these stars that makes the system utterly broken and hugely painful. The fan 
                  backlash was so vocal that Respawn had to roll down the changes a bit by making stars cost <em>5,000</em> experience points instead of <em>10,000</em>, which is still a few
                  times more compared to the previous Battle Passes.
               </p>
               <p>In an extensive AMA thread on Reddit, <u class="article_underline"><em>Apex Legends</em></u> developers from Respawn answered various questions from the community. Addressing the implemented
                  Battle Pass progression changes, game director Chad Grenier told that there was a simple reason for making things generally slower. Previously, players
                  tended to unlock the whole series of Battle Pass rewards only two-thirds into seasons, which left them unoccupied for the remaining third. Based on this data,
                  Respawn’s intention with Season 7 was to engage players throughout the whole period. As spotted by <em>Eurogamer</em>, one of Reddit users accused the studio of not being 
                  able to deliver enough content to engage players, forcing them to grind more hours for the Battle Pass progression instead. Grenier fended the accusation off by 
                  saying that the team has doubled in size to satisfy the demand for new content. He also refused to crunch the team into working 15-hour shifts to deliver more 
                  content, saying that he would rather maintain healthy working conditions, which is part of why Apex Legends updates don't come as frequently as they do in some 
                  competing games.

               <p><u class="article_underline"><em>Apex Legends</em></u> still can expect some new seasonal content coming this December with the returning festive Holo-Day Bash event. According to a few 
                  seemingly intentional leaks, the event is coming back alongside fan-favorite limited-time mode Winter Express. The LTM might already be undergoing internal 
                  testing, while respective reward badges are currently available in the game, according to players. This is without doubts an exciting piece of news, as the <em>Winter 
                  Express</em> mode was among the most widely loved ones with its clear emphasis on constant action accompanied by a cheery holiday soundtrack.
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>While the no-crunch policy is undoubtedly a favorable decision for the <u class="article_underline"><em>Apex Legends</em></u> development team, the game does 
                  lack regular content - especially when compared to its direct competitors like <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Warzone</em>. Both the aforementioned games receive new updates much 
                  more frequently, which ultimately does put Apex Legends at a disadvantage. Despite complaints from some players, though, the decision to slow down updates 
                  for the sake of the actual people behind them is the right call.
