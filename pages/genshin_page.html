               <p>A new trailer for <u class="article_underline"><em>Genshin Impact’s</em></u> Version 1.2 update has been released, revealing the new Dragonspine map region, characters, and a fast-approaching
                  release date. The fresh faces coming with the players' parties in the update were already previously leaked during the game's beta, although it was
                  never previously confirmed by <em>miHoYo</em> who would actually be introduced with in which update.
               </p>
               <p>The game’s most recent update, Version 1.1, introduced four new characters, including Tartaglia, Diona, Zhongli, and Xinyan. <em>MiHoYo</em> introduced the 
                  new characters in pairs, with Tartaglia and Diona featured in one banner and Zhongli and Xinyan in another afterwards. Notably, players began asking <em>MiHoYo</em>
                  to buff Zhongli soon after he was introduced, with players feeling that the character isn’t doing as much damage as they’d like.
               </p>
               <p><em>MiHoYo's</em> new trailer for Version 1.2 announced the release date of the The Chalk Prince and the Dragon, launching very soon on <b>December 23, 2020</b>.
                  The trailer also shows off <u class="article_underline">new party members Albedo and Ganyu</u>, two of the new characters that coming in the next major update. Albedo is a Geo element
                  sword user and plays a major role in the update’s story, while Ganyu is a new bow-wielding Cryo user, similar to Diona from the Version 1.1 update.

            </div>
            <div class="article2">
               <p>The trailer also features the game’s first new zone, the Dragonspine region where the update’s story will be set, giving viewers a great look at the new
                  area’s snow-covered landscape. According to <em>miHoYo</em>, the Dragonspine region is where the remains of the venomous Durin, the dragon that was first introduced
                  during the game’s first chapter, are held after being defeated by Dvalin. This new look at update 1.2 also teases some of the new weapons that will be introduced
                  with the update, including a sword called the Festering Desire, which seems to play an important role in the story, as well as a new spear, catalyst, and greatsword.
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>Just like Gensin Impact’s 1.1 update, there’s definitely a lot for players to look forward to when Version 1.2 comes out in a few weeks. It’s unclear whether <em>MiHoYo</em>
                  plans to announce more characters for the update in order to match the four of the previous one, so players will just have to wait and see if the developer makes any
                  new announcements before the update’s release. In the meantime, players still have a few days to complete the game’s ongoing Gliding Challenge event while they wait.
