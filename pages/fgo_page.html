               <p>While <u class="article_underline"><b><em>Fate Grand Order</em></b></u> is all about collecting players' favorite Servants, doing so gets a lot easier when they understand FGO Craft Essences, 
                  the items that function a lot like equipment in traditional RPG titles. <u class="article_underline"><em>Fate Grand Order</em></u> Craft Essences provide Servants with various important bonuses,
                  rounding out their skills - often referred to as "kits" by veteran players - and making up for any of the shortcomings that they naturally possess.
               </p>
               <p>For those unfamiliar with <em>FGO</em>, the game is a mobile title developed by Delightworks and published by Aniplex. FGO is based on the extremely popular Fate franchise,
                  perhaps most well-known in the West thanks to its anime titles like <em>Fate/Stay Night</em> and <em>Fate/Zero</em>. FGO even has its own anime that follows certain chapters, or
                  Singularities, in the game. With mobile gaming making up a large portion of video game profits and more fans starting to use their phones as primary platforms for 
                  gaming, <em>FGO</em> continues to remain consistently one of the most popular titles available on Android and iOS.
               </p>
               <p>One element of the game that might be confusing to the many new players picking it up over time is FGO Craft Essences. Learning what <em>FGO</em> Craft Essences are,
                  how best to use them, and how to acquire them is an important step in stepping up any player's game. For those new to <u class="article_underline"><em>Fate Grand Order</em></u>, we've put together a 
                  rundown of all the basics of <em>FGO</em> Craft Essences and how to best use them with the Servants on a given Master's roster.

               <p>First and foremost, aspiring Masters will want to know exactly what FGO Craft Essences are. Craft Essences are cards that exist outside a 
                  Servant's given Quick, Arts, and Buster deck and can, with some exceptions, be equipped by any Servant. Craft Essences give a Servant a bonus to 
                  their <u class="article_underline">Hit Points (HP)</u> or <u class="article_underline">Attack (ATK)</u>, with some offering extra stats for both. Each Craft Essence also has a special effect attributed to it, and 
                  the range of these effects spans extremely simple ones to some complex, niche functionalities. In general, lower rarity FGO Craft Essences will have much
                  simpler effects as they're the ones that will likely be encountered by newer players most often, while rare Craft Essences are harder to understand at 
                  first glance but offer some of the game's most powerful bonus effects.
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>Getting <em>FGO</em> Craft Essences is easy, though the best ones will typically be locked behind certain events or as <b>5-Star</b> rolls in the gacha system. 
                  Players can simply roll as they would for any Servant and they will also acquire Craft Essences along the way. Some promotions also give out 
                  Craft Essences, and some strong options can be bought in the event store of a given event simply by acquiring enough currency by completing 
                  quests, so that's strongly recommended for new players to focus on when these offers roll around.
